A regular polygon has 'n' number of sides. Each side has length 's'.

* The area of regular polygon is: (0.25*n*s^2)/tan(pi/n)
* The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon

'polysum' that takes 2 arguments, 
Input
    n (Int) > 0   number of sides
    s (Float) > 0 length of each side
    
Output
    Sums the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon. 
    The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
